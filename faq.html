            Roll Call is a completely free<span id="start-party">ðŸŽ‰</span>
            voice chat service with podcast quality recording.

          <h2>FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</h2>
          <p>
            This page answers common questions and explains how
            to use all the "hidden" features in Roll Call.

          </ul>
          <h4 id="podcast-quality">Basic calling.</h4>
          <p>You can click the start link on the <a href="/">front page</a>, or just click
            <span id="start-call-link">this</span> to start a new call.
          </p>
          <script>
            const random = () => Math.random().toString(36).substring(7)
            document.getElementById('start-call-link').onclick = () => {
              window.location = '/?room=' + random()
            }
          </script>

          <p>
            You can invite other people to the call simply by sharing
            the <strong>URL</strong> with anyone you'd like to have join. You can also modify the URL's <em>room</em> paramater to create something more permanent
            that you and your friend can continue to return to.
          </p>


          <h4 id="podcast-quality">What does "podcast quality recording" mean?</h4>
          <p>
            You're probably used to hearing short delays
            and clipping as the audio adjusts to bandwidth conditions
            when using online calling tools.
            When you record a call on Roll Call it does not record
            the audio you're hearing, which is optimized for latency.
          </p>
          <p>
            Roll Call records every participant <strong>locally</strong> and
            sends that audio to the person who intiated the recording.
            You'll notice when you initiate a recording that each the
            element for each participant shows the status of their
            recording. That includes the data transfered in real time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Browsers are limited in the formats and bitrates they can record.
            But the largest loss in quality during recording comes from the
            tradeoffs of maintaining a realtime call, which we avoid.
          </p>
          <h4>How is this free?</h4>
          <p>
            Roll Call uses WebRTC, a peer-to-peer realtime standard for
            browsers. This means that the infrastructure for the calls is
            minimal and only used for signaling. The bulk of what would
            normally cost money, like hosting fees, are unnecessary since
            it's peer-to-peer, so this project remains free and entirely Open Source.

            However, you can support the development of this project on
            <a class="patreon" href="https://www.patreon.com/mikeal">Patreon</a>.
            This helps
            sustain the project and prioritize it over other open source
            work.
